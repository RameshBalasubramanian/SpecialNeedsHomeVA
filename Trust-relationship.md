# Conceptual Initial Plan: Special Needs Community Group Home

# Overview

This plan outlines the creation of a Special Needs Community Group Home, governed by a Core Founding Parents Council, and structured into two distinct but interdependent workstreams:

1. **Founding Builders Trust (FBT):** Focused on site development, legal setup, construction, and financial closure.  
2. **Group Home Operational Trust (GHOT):** Focused on sustaining the day-to-day operations, community services, and long-term administration.

The model maintains strict delineation between individual ownership (via Special Needs Trusts) and shared services, ensuring both fiduciary clarity and sustainable community support.


# 1. Founding Builders Trust (FBT)

**Purpose:**

- Ensure design meets special needs accessibility codes  

### D. Site Planning & Construction

# 2. Group Home Operational Trust (GHOT)

**Purpose:**  
To manage and sustain daily operations, shared amenities, staffing, and administration of the community.

# Ownership & Financial Boundary Model

Each special needs adult owns their unit via a Special Needs Trust (SNT) created by their parents. These SNTs are legally independent of the Group Home Operational Trust (GHOT).

GHOT is responsible for shared services and does not own or control personal property or assets.

This separation ensures fiduciary independence for each resident and protects personal inheritance or additional care needs.
