## Conceptual Initial Plan: Special Needs Community Group Home

### Overview
This plan outlines the creation of a Special Needs Community Group Home, governed by a Core Founding Parents Council, and structured into two distinct but interdependent
workstreams:
1. Founding Builders Trust (FBT): Focused on site development, legal setup, construction, and financial closure.
2. Group Home Operational Trust (GHOT): Focused on sustaining the day-to-day operations, community services, and long-term administration.
The model maintains strict delineation between individual ownership (via Special Needs Trusts) and shared services, ensuring both fiduciary clarity and sustainable community support.

### 1. Founding Builders Trust (FBT)
Purpose: To establish, acquire, and build the community site and infrastructure. This trust is
temporary and will dissolve after Phase 1 completion unless extended.
