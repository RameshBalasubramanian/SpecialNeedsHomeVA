# Requirements for Lifelong, Self-Sustaining Independent Living: Parent & Autistic Adult Perspectives

This outlines key requirements for planning housing and support systems designed to enable a young autistic adult to live independently throughout their life in a self-sustaining manner. It balances the parents' desire for safety and long-term security with the autistic adult's fundamental need for autonomy and a fulfilling life.

## 1. Core Philosophy & Housing Model

* **Parent Perspective:** A stable, secure, and permanent housing solution that will reliably exist and function even after parents are no longer able to oversee it. Peace of mind is paramount.
* **Autistic Adult Perspective:** **Autonomy** and **Choice** are central. A place that is truly *theirs*, where they make the decisions about their life and environment.
* **Requirement:**
    * A housing model geared towards **permanence and self-sustainability**. This could include:
        * Individual home ownership (potentially funded/supported by a Special Needs Trust).
        * Shared ownership/co-operative models with other individuals/families.
        * Units within a well-established non-profit with a dedicated endowment ensuring long-term operation independent of fluctuating annual funding.
    * A core operating philosophy centered on **person-centered practices**, maximizing resident control and respecting individual preferences.

## 2. Safety & Security (Physical, Emotional, Financial)

* **Parent Perspective:** Ensuring the adult child is safe from harm, accidents, exploitation, and neglect, especially when unsupervised. Need for reliable emergency support and oversight long-term.
* **Autistic Adult Perspective:** Feeling safe, secure, and comfortable in their own home *without* feeling constantly monitored or controlled. Knowing how to get help when needed.
* **Requirement:**
    * **Physical Security:** Safe neighborhood (considering factors relevant to Fairfax/Northern Virginia), secure locks, robust fire/carbon monoxide detection (visual and auditory alerts). Well-maintained property.
    * **Emergency Preparedness:** Clear, practiced emergency plans (medical, fire, weather, power outage). Easily accessible emergency contacts. Potential for non-intrusive alert systems (e.g., fall detection, inactivity monitoring, resident-activated panic buttons) chosen and controlled by the resident where possible.
    * **Personal Safety:** Support and skill-building around navigating the community safely, recognizing risks, understanding boundaries, and avoiding exploitation.
    * **Emotional Safety:** A supportive, non-judgmental environment where the individual feels respected and understood. Staff trained in trauma-informed care and de-escalation. Protection from bullying or manipulation.
    * **Lifelong Oversight:** A plan for future advocacy and oversight after parents are gone (e.g., designated trustee, advocate, committee, sibling involvement as agreed upon).

## 3. Housing Design & Environment

* **Parent Perspective:** Durable, easy-to-maintain environment. Design features that mitigate potential safety risks and support independence.
* **Autistic Adult Perspective:** **Control over their sensory environment** is critical. Space needs to be personalized, comfortable, predictable, and facilitate self-regulation. Privacy is essential.
* **Requirement:**
    * **Sensory Control:** Individual control over lighting (dimmers, color temp options, blackout blinds), sound (soundproofing, quiet appliances, personal audio options), temperature, and potentially scents. Minimal visual clutter encouraged by ample storage.
    * **Personalization & Privacy:** Private bedroom and bathroom minimum. Ability to decorate and arrange personal space according to preference. Clear boundaries respected by staff/visitors.
    * **Accessibility & Universal Design:** Features supporting aging-in-place (e.g., single-floor living options, wide doorways, lever handles, potential for grab bars/roll-in shower). Non-slip flooring.
    * **Durability & Quality:** Use of high-quality, durable materials to ensure longevity and reduce long-term maintenance costs for self-sustainability.
    * **Technology Integration:** Smart home features chosen by the resident to enhance independence (e.g., automated reminders, lighting control, security) and/or safety alerts. Reliable high-speed internet.
    * **Location-Specific Design:** Consider features suitable for Virginia climate (e.g., reliable heating/cooling).

## 4. Support System & Staffing

* **Parent Perspective:** Reliable, consistent, compassionate, and well-trained support staff available when needed. Low staff turnover. Assurance of backup support.
* **Autistic Adult Perspective:** Support available **on their terms** – flexible, respectful, non-intrusive. Having choice and control over *who* provides support and *what* support looks like. Focus on enabling, not just doing for them.
* **Requirement:**
    * **Flexible & Person-Centered Support:** Support hours and types tailored to individual needs and preferences, adaptable over time as needs change. May range from minimal check-ins to significant daily support.
    * **Resident Choice & Control:** Maximum feasible control by the resident over selecting, scheduling, and managing their support staff (potentially via Consumer-Directed models using waiver funds).
    * **Qualified & Vetted Staff:** Thorough background checks. Staff trained specifically in autism, communication methods, positive behavior supports, person-centered planning, and respecting autonomy. Consistency is key.
    * **Reliability & Backup:** Clear plan for backup staffing in case of illness or absence. Low staff-to-resident ratio appropriate to needs.
    * **Focus on Skill Building:** Support includes coaching/assistance with life skills as desired by the resident (cooking, cleaning, finances, scheduling, community navigation) to enhance independence.

## 5. Financial Structure & Sustainability

* **Parent Perspective:** A robust financial plan ensuring the housing and necessary supports are funded for the individual's entire life, independent of parental finances eventually. Protection of assets.
* **Autistic Adult Perspective:** Having necessary resources available for living expenses, personal needs, and chosen activities. Understanding and participating in budgeting/finances to the extent possible/desired.
* **Requirement:**

    * **Financial Management Support:** Assistance with budgeting, bill paying, and financial literacy tailored to the individual's abilities and preferences. Clear financial oversight and reporting (e.g., from trustee).
    * **Affordability:** Ensuring resident's contribution (rent/fees) is affordable based on their income (SSI, wages, etc.).

## 6. Community Integration & Social Life

* **Parent Perspective:** Opportunities for the adult child to have friendships, engage in meaningful activities, and not be isolated.
* **Autistic Adult Perspective:** Access to community and social opportunities **based on personal choice and interest**. Control over social interactions; ability to easily retreat. Avoiding forced socialization.

* **Autistic Adult Perspective:** Involvement and control in the planning and moving process. Support during the transition period. Knowing their preferences will continue to be honored in the future.
* **Requirement:**
    * **Person-Centered Transition:** Gradual transition plan developed *with* the autistic adult. Opportunities for visits, overnight stays before the final move.
    * **Dynamic Planning:** Regular reviews and updates to the support plan and potentially the living arrangement itself to accommodate changing needs, abilities, and preferences over the lifespan.
