# Planning Considerations for Adult Autism Accommodation Project in Virginia

Planning an accommodation project for autistic adults is a significant undertaking. Here is a list of items and areas that need careful consideration, particularly with a focus on Virginia:

## 1. Vision, Mission, and Scope

* **Target Population:** Define specifically who the housing is for. Consider the range of support needs (e.g., level of independence, communication styles, sensory sensitivities, co-occurring conditions). Will it serve individuals requiring minimal support, 24/7 care, or a mix?
* **Housing Model:** Decide on the type of accommodation. Options include:
    * Group Homes (typically 4-8 residents, licensed)
    * Supported Living Apartments (individuals live in their own apartments with staff support available)
    * Intentional Communities (mixed neurotypes living together)
    * Independent Living with supports (episodic support in individual homes/apartments)
* **Project Goals:** What outcomes are you aiming for? (e.g., maximizing independence, community integration, skill development, safety and well-being, reducing isolation).
* **Philosophy of Care:** Establish a core philosophy (e.g., person-centered planning, promoting autonomy, trauma-informed care).

## 2. Legal, Licensing, and Regulatory (Virginia Specific)

* **Licensing Body:** **(Virginia Specific)** The Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services (DBHDS) licenses providers of services for individuals with developmental disabilities, including residential settings like group homes.
* **Licensing Requirements:** **(Virginia Specific)** Understand and plan for DBHDS licensing regulations (12VAC35-105). This involves:
    * Submitting an Initial Provider Application packet.
    * Developing compliant policies and procedures (including human rights, safety, service description).
    * Staff background checks (criminal history, child protective services registry).
    * Physical site requirements and inspections (including potential health/sanitation inspections by VDH).
    * Demonstrating compliance with Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) settings rules if using Medicaid Waiver funding.
* **Zoning and Permits:** Investigate local zoning laws and necessary building permits in the specific city or county in Virginia.
* **Fair Housing and ADA:** Ensure compliance with the federal Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act regarding non-discrimination and reasonable accommodations/modifications.
* **Resident Agreements:** Develop clear lease or residency agreements outlining rights, responsibilities, fees, and house rules.

## 3. Location and Site Selection

* **Proximity to Services:** Access to healthcare (doctors, dentists, therapists), grocery stores, pharmacies, banks.
* **Community Integration:** Location should facilitate access to employment opportunities, volunteer work, recreational activities, libraries, parks, and public transportation. **(Virginia Specific)** Research shows preventing isolation is a key concern for families in Virginia.
* **Safety and Neighborhood:** Assess the safety and accessibility of the surrounding neighborhood.
* **Site Suitability:** Consider lot size, topography, potential environmental concerns, and utility access.

## 4. Design and Environment (Sensory & Universal Design Focus)

* **Sensory-Friendly Design:** This is crucial for autistic individuals who may have hyper- or hypo-sensitivities. Consider:
    * _Acoustics:_ Excellent soundproofing (walls, floors, ceilings), quiet HVAC systems and appliances, soft-close drawers/cabinets, use of sound-absorbing materials (carpets, acoustic panels), graduating transitions between noisy/quiet zones.
    * _Lighting:_ Maximize natural light but control glare (blinds, window films), use dimmable and adjustable LED lighting (avoid fluorescent), provide task lighting, consider color temperature options.
    * _Visuals:_ Use calming, neutral color palettes, minimize visual clutter (ample built-in storage), avoid busy patterns, use clear and simple wayfinding/signage.
    * _Spatial Layout:_ Clear, predictable layouts, wider hallways/doorways, defined spaces for different activities, quiet rooms or alcoves for retreat, rounded corners on furniture/walls.
    * _Materials/Textures:_ Consider tactile sensitivities â€“ offer variety but avoid overwhelming textures unless specifically desired in sensory spaces. Use durable, easy-to-clean materials.
* **Universal Design:** Incorporate principles that benefit everyone, such as zero-step entries, wider doorways, lever door handles, accessible bathrooms (grab bars, roll-in showers).
* **Safety Features:** Secure entryways, potentially enclosed outdoor spaces (yards, balconies), considerations for wandering if applicable, robust fire safety systems (visual and auditory alarms), elimination of sharp edges.
* **Technology:** Potential for smart home technology (automated lighting, temperature control), assistive technology integration, reliable internet access.
* **Outdoor Space:** Access to safe, potentially sensory-friendly outdoor areas (gardens, patios, walking paths).
* **Individualization:** Provide private bedrooms/personal space and allow for personalization.

## 5. Support Services and Staffing

* **Needs Assessment:** Implement a thorough process to understand each resident's specific support needs (personal care/ADLs, medication management, behavioral support, community access, skill-building, medical coordination).
* **Staffing Model:** Determine the level of staffing required (e.g., 24/7 awake staff, live-in support, periodic check-ins). Plan for adequate staff-to-resident ratios.
* **Staff Qualifications and Training:** Recruit staff with experience and provide ongoing, autism-specific training (communication, sensory needs, positive behavior supports, crisis prevention/intervention, person-centered planning, potentially **(Virginia Specific)** DBHDS-required trainings).
* **Service Coordination:** Plan for coordination with external providers (case managers/support coordinators, therapists, medical professionals, employment specialists).
* **Person-Centered Planning:** Ensure support plans are individualized, respect resident choice and preference, and are regularly reviewed and updated with the individual's input.

## 6. Funding and Financial Sustainability

* **Project Budget:** Develop a comprehensive budget covering land/building acquisition, design, construction/renovation, furnishings, permits, professional fees, start-up operational costs, and ongoing operations.
* **Funding Sources (Virginia Specific):** Explore a mix of potential sources:
    * _Medicaid Waivers:_ **(Virginia Specific)** Virginia's DD Waivers (Building Independence, FIS, CL) and the CCC+ Waiver can fund support services (not room and board directly, but can enable individuals to live in the community). Understanding waiver slots, waiting lists (especially for DD waivers), and eligibility criteria via the local Community Services Board (CSB) is crucial.
    * _Rental Assistance:_ HUD Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, HUD Section 811 Project Rental Assistance (PRA), **(Virginia Specific)** DBHDS State Rental Assistance Program (SRAP) for eligible individuals.
    * _Development Funding:_ **(Virginia Specific)** Virginia Housing Trust Fund (VHTF), DHCD's Affordable and Special Needs Housing (ASNH) program, Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), HOME funds, National Housing Trust Fund.
    * _Grants:_ **(Virginia Specific)** Virginia Housing Accessibility Grants (for modifications), private foundations, community development grants.
    * _Private Pay:_ Funds from residents/families, Special Needs Trusts, ABLE accounts.
    * _Fundraising/Donations._
* **Resident Costs:** Determine the financial model for residents (rent, fees for services based on support needs). Ensure affordability, considering residents' income sources (SSI, SSDI, wages).
* **Long-Term Sustainability:** Create a realistic operational budget and plan for ongoing financial health.

## 7. Community Integration and Resident Life

* **Socialization:** Plan for structured and informal opportunities for social interaction among residents and within the wider community, combating potential isolation.
* **Activities:** Facilitate access to recreational, educational, vocational, and leisure activities based on resident interests.
* **Transportation:** Plan for reliable transportation options (staff transport, public transit access, ride-sharing services).
* **Resident Involvement:** Create mechanisms for resident input into house rules, activities, and operational decisions.
* **Building Community Connections:** Foster positive relationships with neighbors and the local community.

## 8. Admissions, Transition, and Operations

* **Admissions Process:** Develop clear eligibility criteria and a fair, transparent admissions process. Ensure good resident-to-environment fit.
* **Transition Planning:** Create individualized transition plans for new residents involving pre-visits, familiarization, and gradual integration to ease adjustment. Open communication with the individual and their support network is key.
* **Operational Management:** Plan for day-to-day management, maintenance, emergency procedures, quality improvement processes, and ongoing compliance.
