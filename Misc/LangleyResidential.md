In FY 2021, **Group Home expenses totaled ~$1.3 million**, or approximately:
- ~$72,000 per person per year
- If 4‚Äì6 residents per home: **$288,000 to $432,000 per home per year**

### 2. **Staffing and Personnel Costs**
Over **60% of Langley's total expenses** are for **salaries, benefits, and taxes**‚Äîreflecting intensive staffing for 24/7 residential care.  
You can assume:
- Direct support staff per home (~3‚Äì5 FTE)
- Manager/supervisor (~0.5 FTE)
- Average personnel cost per home: **$200,000‚Äì$300,000 annually**

### 3. **Administrative and Overhead Allocation**

### 4. **Funding Patterns**
- **80‚Äì85% of Langley‚Äôs income** comes from **government grants and Medicaid Waiver reimbursements**
